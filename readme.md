- The system should hold data of multiple medical departments || wings of the hospital.
- It should contain the details of different patients from each department in separate databases.
- There should be a system to store payment details.
- The system should have a feature so that the patients can check the availability of different doctors and book their appointment in advance.
- There should be real-time tracking of all the doctors who are currently busy and who are currently free so that patients can be allocated accordingly.
- Patients should be allowed to access only their medical records and view test results.
- Patients should be allowed to provide feedback on their experience with the hospital and its staff, helping the hospital to identify their areas for improvement.
